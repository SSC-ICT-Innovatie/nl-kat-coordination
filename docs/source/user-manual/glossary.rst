   * - Term
     - Definition
   * - Object
     - The information collected by OpenKAT is stored as objects.
       Objects can be anything, like DNS records, hostnames, URLs, IP addresses, software, software versions, ports, etc.
   * - Object type
     - The type of object, for example IP address, hostname, network, or DNS record.
   * - Object set
     - A saved collection of objects based on filter criteria. Object sets are used for scheduling scans and generating reports.
   * - Finding
     - A security vulnerability or misconfiguration that has been discovered by OpenKAT.
   * - Finding type
     - Findings discovered by OpenKAT are categorized by finding types, each with a unique code, name, description, and severity score.
   * - Plugin
     - A containerized scanner that collects information or analyzes objects. Plugins run automatically when objects meet the required clearance level.
   * - Task
     - A task is created for each job that needs to be performed, such as running a plugin or generating a report.
       Not every task results in findings or new objects.
   * - Schedule
     - A recurring task that runs automatically at specified intervals (daily, weekly, etc.) to scan objects or generate reports.
   * - File
     - Files uploaded to or generated by OpenKAT, including raw scan outputs, generated reports, and manually uploaded data.
   * - Business rule
     - A custom SQL query that generates findings based on organization-specific security policies and compliance requirements.
   * - Clearance type
     - The clearance type tells how the object was added to the Objects list.
       **Declared** objects were manually added by the user or have an explicitly set scan level.
       **Inherited** objects automatically inherit their scan level from related objects through DNS relationships.
       **Empty** objects do not have a scan level set yet.
   * - Clearance level
     - Also called scan level. The clearance level of an object tells OpenKAT how deeply it can scan the object (L0-L4).
   * - Scan level
     - The scan level of a plugin indicates the minimum clearance level required for objects to be scanned by that plugin. OpenKAT ensures plugins never exceed the clearance level of objects.
   * - Report
     - A PDF document summarizing security findings, metrics, and insights. Reports can be generated manually or scheduled for automatic creation.
